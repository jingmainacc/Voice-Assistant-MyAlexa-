<h1>Voice Assistant "MyAlexa"</h1>

 ### [MyAlexa Website Deployed in HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/camanalo1/MyAlexaExperiment)

<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a voice assistant named MyAlexa using Gradio, which was deployed on Hugging Face
Spaces. The project is a functional assistant capable of answering general questions using advanced language
models. Successfully created a voice assistant that generated meaningful responses to basic questions. Gained
valuable experience in integrating various AI models and deploying applications.

<br />


<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

- Facebook's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): For converting spoken language into text.
- Phi-3 Large Language Model (LLM): For understanding and generating natural language responses.
- Facebook's Text-to-Speech (TTS): For converting text responses back into spoken language.
- Gradio: For developing the user interface and deploying the application.


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Hugging Face Website: The platform where the voice assistant application is deployed, allowing users to interact with MyAlexa online.</b>
